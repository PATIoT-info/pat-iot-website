# Client Logos

Place your client logo images here. The website expects:

- **client-1.png** through **client-6.png** (or .jpg) – add as many as you need
- Recommended: PNG or JPG, transparent or white background
- Recommended size: about 200–400px wide, height proportional (logos will be displayed at max 160×80px and scale to fit)
- You can add more logos by editing the "Our Clients" section in `index.html` and duplicating the `.client-logo` items in both the first set and the "Duplicate for seamless loop" set

The logos auto-scroll horizontally in the "Our Clients" section. To add more than 6 clients, copy a `.client-logo` block in index.html for each new client (and add the same block again in the duplicate section for the loop).
